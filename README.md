# Project : Periodic Process Logger with Auto Scheduled Log Report Facility 

Technology : Python

Description : 

- In this project we create log file with the current time and store information about all running processes as its name ,
PID, memory usage.
- Our automation script executes periodically depends on the time specified
by the user using 
scheduler of python.After periodic execution it sends the log file to the specified email address.

To run the script:
- python3 PeriodicLogger.py [OPTIONS] or [PATH]

- Option : -h help -u usage

Path: Absolute path where you want to create the log file.

# Project : File Packer and Unpacker

Technology : Java Programming

Description : 

This project is used to perform process monitoring activity. This Project is divided into 2 parts as Packing and Unpacking. By using this project we can fetch data from all files and merge it into one file. As well as we can also extract all packed file whenever required.

The main reason to do this project is to understand File system call like open() , creat() , read() , write(),etc
- Application_Name: File Packer-Unpacker
